# Created a Baseline Situational Factors Predictive Model for Comparison Purposes

- Predictors:

  - Quarter
  - Down
  - Yards to Go
  - Yardline Number
  - Shotgun Formation
  - Half Seconds Remaining  
  - Score Differential
  
--

- Accuracy: 72.6%
- Brier Score: 0.1983135

# Defining Variables Created from Tracking Data

- Width of Formation + Standard Deviation
- Width of Offensive Line + Standard Deviation 
- Depth of Offensive Line
- Deep Backfield RB- Indicator Variable
- QB Position (Under Center, Shotgun, Pistol)
- Personnel (Number of WRs, RBs, TEs)
- Fullback- Indicator Variable

## Using Only Tracking Data Variables to Predict Play Type Results in a Similar Accuracy to the Only Situational Factors Model

--

- Situational Factors Only Accuracy: 72.6%

- Tracking Data Variables Only Accuracy: 71.6%

## Using a Mixture of Tracking Data Variables and Situational Variables Produces the Most Accurate Model

--

- Situational Factors Only Accuracy: 72.6%

- Tracking Data Variables Only Accuracy: 71.6%

- Mixture of Situational Factors and Tracking Data Variables Accuracy: 73.65079%

# Completed Work

- Created variables using tracking data
- Created a basic model using only play by play data
- Started creating models using tracking data variables

--

# Future Work

- More variables from tracking data
- Better accuracy
- Look at predictability of NFL teams
- Pinpoint the strengths of our model

### Definitions of the Variables Created From Tracking Data 

- Width of Formation
  - Width (in yards) of the offensive formation at the snap
  - Horizontal distance between the players closest to each sideline
  - Maximum Y value of offensive players at the snap minus the minimum Y value of offensive players at the snap
  
- Width of Offensive Line
  - Width (in yards) of the offensive line at the snap
  - Horizontal distance between the right most lineman and left most lineman
  - Maximum Y value of offensive linemen at the snap minus the minimum Y value of offensive linemen at the snap

- Depth of Offensive Line
  - Helps to understand the effects of offensive line curvature
  - Maximum X value of offensive linemen at the snap minus the minimum X value of offensive linemen at the snap

### Definitions of the Variables Created From Tracking Data Cnt.

- Deep Backfield RB- Indicator Variable
  - 1 indicates the RB is greater than or equal to 4 yards behind the QB at the snap
  - 0 indicates the RB is less than 4 yards behind the QB at the snap

- QB Position (Under Center, Shotgun, Pistol)
  - Three separate indicator variables showing QB positioning
  - 1 indicates the QB is in that position at the snap
  - 0 indicates the QB is not in that position at the snap

- Personnel (Number of WRs, RBs, TEs)
  - Three separate variables indicating the number of players on the field at the snap in each of the position         groups

- Fullback- Indicator Variable
  - 1 indicates there is a fullback on the field at the snap
  - 0 indicates there is not a fullback on the field at the snap
