# The Data

```{r out.width='70%', echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("BDB_Schema.png")
```

---

# Created a Baseline Situational Factors Predictive Model for Comparison Purposes

- Predictors:

  - Quarter
  - Down
  - Yards to Go
  - Yardline Number
  - Half Seconds Remaining  
  - Score Differential
  
--

- Accuracy: 63.27%
- Brier Score: 0.2085403

# Defining Variables Created from Tracking Data

- Width of Formation + Standard Deviation
- Width of Offensive Line + Standard Deviation 
- Depth of Offensive Line

# Defining Variables Created from Tracking Data

- Width of Formation + Standard Deviation
- Width of Offensive Line + Standard Deviation 
- Depth of Offensive Line
- Deep Backfield RB- Indicator Variable
- QB Position (Under Center, Shotgun, Pistol)
- Personnel (Number of WRs, RBs, TEs)
- Fullback- Indicator Variable

# Completed Work

- Created variables using tracking data
- Created a basic model using only play by play data
- Created models including tracking data variables
- Investigated the predictability of each team
- Looked at how our model does in specific subsets
- Expanded our model to update predictions within the first 2.5 seconds of the play
